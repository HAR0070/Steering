This package can used to perform the lidar-lidar and lidar camera calibration

Inputs:
a. camera images (Right and left camera)
b. Lidar data (Single lidar pointcloud, If more than one lidar is used, transform all the lidar pointcloud into one fixed frame[here we used two lidars left and right lidars, we merged the left lidar pointcloud and transformed into the right lidar frame and called it merged pointcloud)

Output:
Synchornized lidar pointcloud and camera data in a rosbag

Commands to obtain the result:

# Launch lidars  - Ensure all the lidars are turned on and connected, if needed ping the lidars from the computer and check for the data
roslaunch ouster_ros two_lidar_driver.launch

# Launch cameras - Ensure both the cameras are connected and turned on, check the data using the rqt_image_view plugin
roslaunch ids_multi_cam camera_launch.launch

# Multiple lidar calibration - Make sure the esimates provided are properly, failed to do this will result in false convergence
roslaunch multi_lidar_calibrator multi_lidar_calibrator.launch points_parent_src:=/ouster1/points points_child_src:=/ouster2/points x:=0.0 y:=3 z:=0.0 roll:=0.0 pitch:=0.0 yaw:=0.0

# Merge the lidar pointlcouds into one fixed frame(here we choose right lidar as the fixed frame) using the transform generated by the above Multiple lidar calibration tool
rosrun lidar_merge lidar_ros

# To launch the RADAR one has to give the permission to access the port and then load the ROS environment and start the data_sync_node
sudo -E bash -c "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash && source /home/asl/Muni/workspace/devel/setup.bash && rosrun rosradar radar_parse.py"

# To visualize the data published by the Radar node, run the Radar visualizer node
rosrun rosradar radar_msg_visualization.py

# Launch IMU and GPS
#### For any new device, always follow this approach for installing the driver, donot copy-paste direcvtly - https://docs.fixposition.com/fd/installation-and-usage
https://github.com/fixposition/fixposition_driver
##### change the IP in the config.yaml file
roslaunch fixposition_driver_ros1 node.launch

# Sync IMU with GPS
rosrun imu_gps_sync imu_gps_sync.py

# Synchornize the data and store the data into the ROSBAG
rosrun data_sync_node data_sync_node_node

## Important points to consider when doing lidar-camera calibration

1. Make sure the edges and corners of the checkerboard is properly visible in the lidar pointlcoud.(If possible dock yourself so that your head and body donot overlap in the pointcloud)

2. Rotate the checkboard laterally to introduce skew in the checkerboard pointlcoud and also position yourself at different distances from the lidar and camera. This allows to esimate your poistion propely with different samples(Differnt distances and different angles of the checkerboard)

3. Donot place the checkerboard close to the body, move your hand way from the body.

4. Ensure the checkerboard is visible properly in the camera and lidar

5. Alyways keep the checkbaord at 45 degrees so that corners are visible properly in the pointlcoud(45 deg longitudnially)
